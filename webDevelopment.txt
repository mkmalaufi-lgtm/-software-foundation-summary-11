Web Development

Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that people can access using a browser on computers, phones, or tablets. It includes everything from designing how a website looks to making sure it works correctly and can handle users and data.

Web development is made up of three main parts:

1. Front-End Development (Client Side)

This is everything the user sees and interacts with directly. It focuses on the design, layout, colors, menus, buttons, and overall user experience.

Front-end developers use:

HTML — to structure the content (like text, images, and headings)

CSS — to style the website (colors, fonts, layout)

JavaScript — to make the page interactive (like clicking buttons, showing popups)

Front-end development ensures that the site is easy to use, visually appealing, and responsive (works on any device).

2. Back-End Development (Server Side)

The back-end is the hidden part of the website. Users don’t see it, but it makes everything work behind the scenes. It handles tasks like:

Managing user accounts

Processing data

Communicating with the database

Back-end developers use languages like:

Node.js

Python

PHP

Java

Ruby

The back-end runs on servers and ensures the website’s features work properly and securely.

3. Database

A database stores the website’s information, like:

Usernames and passwords

Posts or products

Messages or orders

Common database systems include:

MySQL

MongoDB

PostgreSQL

Putting it all together

A full website needs all three parts:

Front-end for what the user sees

Back-end for how it works

Database for storing information
Front-End is the part of a website or application that the user can see and interact with.
It is also called the client side or user interface (UI).

Everything that appears on the screen is front-end work, such as:

Buttons

Colors

Images

Navigation menus

Text and fonts

Page layout

Forms

Animations and effects
What is Back-End?

Back-End is the hidden part of a website or application — the part that users cannot see, but it makes everything work.
It is also called the server side.

When a user clicks a button, logs in, or submits a form, the back-end handles the logic and processing behind the scenes.

What is a Database?

A Database is a system used to store, organize, and manage data so that it can be used by the back-end of a website or application.
It is like a digital storage room where all information is kept safely.

The database is not visible to the user — it works in the background.
